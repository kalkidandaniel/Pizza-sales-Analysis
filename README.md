# Pizza-sales-Analysis
## Project Background
Bella Napoli, a regional pizza chain based in the Midwestern United States, has been serving handcrafted pizzas since 2015. With multiple branches across cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee, the business caters to a loyal customer base through dine-in, takeaway, and delivery services.

As the business scaled, Bella Napoli began collecting large volumes of order data from its point-of-sale (POS) systems. However, without dedicated analytics support, these insights remained underutilized. The leadership team reached out for support to analyze trends, identify best-selling products, and optimize operational decisions.

### This project delivers actionable insights on:
* KPI Performance: Revenue, orders, and product-level metrics.
* Sales Trends: Daily and hourly ordering behavior.
* Customer Preferences: Category and size breakdowns.
* Product Popularity: Best and worst-selling pizzas.

## Recommendations
### * Leverage High-Performing Products to Drive Revenue
The top five best-selling pizzas ‚Äî including the Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken ‚Äî consistently outperform others in volume. These should be prioritized in promotional campaigns, featured prominently on the menu, and bundled with complementary items to boost upsell opportunities. Conversely, underperforming items like the Brie Carre pizza should be reviewed for potential recipe improvement, repositioning, or removal to streamline the menu and reduce operational inefficiencies.

### * Optimize Staffing and Operations Around Peak Periods
Order volume peaks on Fridays and Saturdays, particularly between 12‚Äì1 PM and 4‚Äì8 PM. Aligning staffing levels and kitchen prep schedules with these demand windows will help reduce wait times and improve service quality. This adjustment can lead to better customer satisfaction and support higher throughput during high-traffic hours.

### * Increase Average Order Value Through Strategic Upselling
With an average order value of $38.30 and an average of 2.32 pizzas per order, there is an opportunity to boost sales further through bundled deals, size upgrades, and premium topping suggestions. Highlighting value-focused combinations, especially for larger sizes, can encourage customers to spend more per transaction while improving perceived value.

### * Introduce Targeted Offers to Stimulate Low-Demand Periods
Slower days like Tuesdays and Sundays present a clear opportunity for growth. Targeted marketing strategies ‚Äî such as midweek discounts, loyalty point multipliers, or family deals ‚Äî can stimulate demand during off-peak times. Promoting medium-size pizzas as affordable and sharable options may also resonate well with price-sensitive customers.
